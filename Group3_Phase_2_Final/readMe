CoreNLP Java Chatbot Program

Phase II - Introduce Stanford CoreNLP Library and start to incorporate 
its' many uses. 

By Using Pipeline, we are able to analyze the UserInput in the SimpleChatbot class.
Stanford CoreNLP can be downloaded off the internet at this site, https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/index.html

But We will walk you through how to get the CoreNLP jar files into the classpath. We recommend using Eclipse or Intelliji IDEA
if you are unfamiliar with classpaths and adding external JAR files to them. 

In Phase I our goal was to make a basic Java chatbot that works, in Phase 2 We worked on implementing CoreNLP's methods
to help analyze UserInput, and to provide feedback to that user about what's going on. 

This project will show you how the CoreNLP Pipeline is able to take in text, tokenize it, and use Annotations
to analyze the tokens within the sentences. 

Hopefully this will be informative and help you understand the basics of Natural Language Processing.
