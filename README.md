# GroupProject
Basic intro/set up using Java, StanfordCore NLP , and a few examples to test Connections to Classpaths. 

please read and follow the steps in the guides I used to get your Programs working as well. This was complicated for me to figure out, but you have 1) Install Stanford Core NLP 
2) UnZip the files to a folder.
3) Setup your Java Project (in eclipse, or IDEA ... etc.)
4) Right Click on Project and Configure BUild Path

5) Add the .JAR files into the projects Class Path

  When you try to import the libraries into your ChatBot.java file, Eclipse or IDEA will let you know if it can't connect to the JAR files (I added all of them into my project just to be safe)
