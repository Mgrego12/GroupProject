**Introduction: **

          For Group 3's Project , we started off with the inclanation to use Core NLP libraries (Pipeline, Annotations(lemma,word,pos), Named Entity Recognition, and Sentiment Analysis to create a Interactive GUI so that the User could ask our SimpleChatbot questions and get a response that would be sensical and informative. 
          Having almost Zero experience with Language Models and NLPs, and having a 2 weeks' late start, we weren't able to use CoreNLP to the level we wanted to. But we were able to create something as a Stepping-Stone for our fellow classmates into the World of CoreNLP and provide examples of just how powerful it is. 

Software / Hardware Used: 
          JDK-17 
          Eclipse IDE 
          Stanford CoreNLP for Java, English 
          

****Please read and follow the steps when importing our Project and the CoreNLP jar Files into Project ClassPath ****               

1) Download Group3Phase3zip 
2) UnZip the files to a folder on your Local machine.
3) Start a new Java Project (in eclipse, or IDEA ... etc.)
4) Right Click on Project and Configure BUild Path

5) Add the .JAR files into the projects Class Path

  When you try to import the libraries into your ChatBot.java file, Eclipse or IDEA will let you know if it can't connect to the JAR files (I added all of them into my project just to be safe)
